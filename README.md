# Build SFML For Android On Windows
Batch scripts to build SFML for Android, using the latest Android NDK

# Requirements

Successfully building SFML requires that you have `cmake` in your `PATH`.

# How to use it

### ⬤ If you have NDK installed:

Run `build-sfml.bat` followed by the absolute path to your NDK. For example, if your NDK is located at D:\NVPACK\android-ndk-r19, then you have to run `build-sfml.bat D:\NVPACK\android-ndk-r19`.
        
### ⬤ If you don't have NDK installed:

You can install the newest version before building SFML, by executing `download-ndk-and-build-sfml.bat`. You can also specify where to install ndk, by providing an absolute path to the script. For example, if you want to install it in D:\Android, then you should run `download-ndk-and-build-sfml.bat D:\AndroidL`.
